This was originally planned to be the repo of the qt6 port of my version, but as you can see, i added some programs that i use with lumina.

# Lumina components (PKGBUILD in `pkg/`)

- `lib/` - The core library for the desktop

- `desktop/` - The interface

- `open/` - XDG-open front-end

- `controlpanel/` - Configuration app

- `fileinfo/` - fileinfo for files

# The other stuff

- `sddm-halawa/` a fork of sugar-candy, made it more simpler

- `compix/` compositor thats based on axcomp which is based on xcompmgr by @xeome

- `7b7b-files/` config
